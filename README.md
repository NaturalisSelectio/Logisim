=================

This is the scheme for a circuit for a scientific calculator. I did using LOGISIM. Please follow the instructions carefully if you want to see how it works. 

The first step is to download LOGISIM. You can do so here: http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/download.html

Next you must download the zip file from the repository that will contain a .jar file and a .circ file. 

After installing LOGISIM, run the jar file. A new LOGISIM window will open and will upload the jar file, which was 
an external library. Go to File-> Open -> ALU32.CIRC
