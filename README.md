Logisim
=================

This is the scheme for a circuit for a scientific calculator. I did using LOGISIM. Please follow the instructions carefully if you want to see how it works. 

The first step is to download LOGISIM. You can do so here: http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/download.html

Next you must download the zip file from the repository that will contain a logisim.jar file and an ALU32.circ file. 

After installing LOGISIM, run the jar file. A new LOGISIM window will open and will upload the jar file, which was 
an external library. Go to File-> Open -> ALU32.CIRC

The second design is a split-memory "Harvard" architecture design: The Program ROM will store a read-only copy of the instructions, and a separate RAM will be used to store data for the program's execution.

In order to see this design you have to open ROMHarvardDesign.circ and when prompted to select the jar file you must choose cs3410.jar
